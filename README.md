## About
MarkIt differs from other note apps by treating your notes as **real files**. There is no hidden database; every note is a plain text Markdown (`.md`) file stored in a folder of your choice on your device. This means you truly own your data—you can sync it, back it up, or open it with any other text editor.

## Development Story
This project is a personal endeavor to build the ideal honest note-taking app. It was developed by a single developer with extensive pair-programming assistance from advanced AI agents. The code reflects a collaboration between human direction and machine intelligence.

## Features

*   **File-Based Storage**: Your notes are yours. Stored as local `.md` files.
*   **Markdown Support**: Full Markdown rendering and editing (Bold, Italic, Lists, Code blocks, etc.).
*   **Grid Layout**: A beautiful staggered grid view (like Google Keep) to see your notes at a glance.
*   **Organization**:
    *   **Folders as Labels**: Use folders to organize notes into categories.
    *   **Pins**: Keep important notes at the top.
    *   **Colors**: Color-code your notes for visual grouping.
    *   **Archive & Trash**: Keep your workspace clutter-free.
*   **Privacy First**: No internet permissions required. No tracking. No cloud lock-in.
